# xidl

`xidl` is an IDL repository for data reduction and more. It is maintained by [JXP](https://www.ucolick.org/~xavier/Welcome.html) and associates, originally through [SVN](https://svn.ucolick.org/xidl/trunk) (unavailable anymore) and currently through [GitHub](https://github.com/profxj/xidl.git).

This is an old version of `xidl` copied from https://github.com/jgagneastro/FireHose_v2/XIDL/xidl. The version number is not known. However, it should be later than v3.0.0 (released June, 2010) according to [doc/README](doc/README), and earlier than the earliest version on [GitHub](https://github.com/profxj/xidl.git). Anyway, this version supports [FireHose](https://github.com/RuiningZHAO/FIREHOSE) well.
